# Dozee-BCG

The problem Dozee- Ballistocardiography solves
Using Supervised Learning to Implement a model to calculate heartrates, breathrates, movement values, bed occupancy and Individual Heartbeats based on piezo values. This will help hospitals to monitor their patients more cost effeciently.

Technologies we used:
1. scikit-learn
2. NumPy
3. pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. os
6. Subprocess


Index
1. Heartrates and Breathrates files corresponding to dataset added to the folder.
2. Data plot - All data visualisations from given data
